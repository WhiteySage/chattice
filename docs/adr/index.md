# Architecture decision records

ADRs capture proposed decisions before implementation. A `Proposed` ADR is a
reviewable design direction, not shipped behavior.

| ADR | Decision | Status |

| [008](ADR-008-sync-async-responses.md) | Separate synchronous and asynchronous response APIs | Accepted |
| [009](ADR-009-google-interaction-normalization.md) | Google interaction envelope and common-data normalization | Accepted |

| [011](ADR-011-versioning-policy.md) | Versioning policy (pre-1.0 development releases) | Accepted |

New records copy [the template](template.md). Accepted decisions are immutable;
later changes supersede them with a new ADR.
